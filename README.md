# Housing Management Project

This project was developed during the Angular sessions by students as part of an active learning pedagogy approach. The initiative applied *project-based learning* and *problem-based learning* methodologies. The goal was to elevate the student experience beyond traditional application exercises and encourage the practical implementation of newly introduced concepts in a real-world project.

## Objectives

- **Active Learning**: Emphasize hands-on learning through real-world scenarios.
- **Skill Development**: Reinforce Angular concepts and apply them in building a complete housing management system.
- **Collaborative Work**: Promote teamwork and collaborative intelligence among students.
- **Problem Solving**: Tackle real-world challenges to solidify theoretical knowledge.

## Features Implemented

- **Home Page**: A streamlined and user-friendly interface for navigation.
- **Search Functionality**: A dynamic search form to filter and list announcements based on user preferences.
- **Announcement Management**: CRUD operations for housing announcements.
- **User Authentication**: Login and registration features for a personalized experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring compatibility across devices.

## Project Highlights

- **Collaborative Approach**: Students worked together to share ideas and overcome challenges.
- **Active Pedagogy**: Learning by doing, where students solved real problems and implemented practical solutions.
- **Real-World Relevance**: Concepts discussed theoretically were applied directly to a tangible project.

## Future Enhancements

The project still has room for improvement, including:

- Better user session management to handle authenticated users dynamically.
- Enhanced security measures to restrict unauthorized actions, such as deleting announcements.
- Refining the user interface for an even more intuitive experience.
### Deployment
